basic tools for solving, generating and running games of Nim

i like Nim a lot; it's one of those weird games where once a computer has control, they should never be able to lose. i decided i'd try to figure out how to solve the next move, just for fun -- and then i just kept going

i may have overcomplicated some things, but i hope the docstrings help make sense of what's going on. comments are minimal and the code is my finest pasta dish
